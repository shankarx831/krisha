# Radioform HAL Driver

A CoreAudio HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) plugin for macOS that creates virtual proxy output devices. When an app sends audio to a proxy device, the driver writes it into shared memory. The host process reads from shared memory, runs DSP, and renders to the real hardware device.

The driver runs inside `coreaudiod` (not as a standalone process). When installed at `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/RadioformDriver.driver`, macOS loads it as a system audio plugin.

`packages/host/Sources/CRadioformAudio/include/RFSharedAudio.h`

## Entry point

```cpp
extern "C" void* RadioformDriverPluginFactory(CFAllocatorRef allocator, CFUUIDRef typeUUID)
```

If `typeUUID` matches `kAudioServerPlugInTypeUUID`, this function lazily creates global driver state and returns the plugin reference. The factory UUID is `B3F04000-8F04-4F84-A72E-B2D4F8E6F1DA` (declared in `Info.plist`).

## Device lifecycle

The driver does not hardcode proxy devices. It reconciles desired devices from a host-written control file.

### Control file: `/tmp/radioform-devices.txt`

Format per line:

```
DeviceName|DeviceUID
```

`MonitorControlFile()` calls `SyncDevices()` every ~1 second (10x 100ms sleeps).

`SyncDevices()` behavior:

- Add proxy device when UID exists in control file, heartbeat for that UID is fresh, and UID is not in cooldown.
- Remove proxy device when UID is no longer desired (missing from file or heartbeat stale).
- Enforce a 10-second cooldown (`DEVICE_COOLDOWN_SEC`) after removal to prevent rapid add/remove cycling.

### Proxy device creation

`CreateProxyDevice()` creates one output-only proxy device with:

- Name: `"<OriginalName> (Radioform)"`
- UID: `"<OriginalUID>-radioform"`
- Manufacturer: `"Radioform"`
- Default format: 48 kHz, 2 channels
- Mixing enabled
- Stream controls via `AddStreamWithControlsAsync(aspl::Direction::Output)`
- IO/control callbacks handled by `UniversalAudioHandler`

## Audio path

### OnStartIO

When the first client starts IO, the handler:

1. Opens `/tmp/radioform-<sanitized-uid>`
2. Maps shared memory with `PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE` and `MAP_SHARED`
3. Validates protocol version, sample rate, and channel count
4. Sets `driver_connected = 1`
5. Pre-allocates conversion buffers (`4096 * RF_MAX_CHANNELS` frames)
6. Prefills half the ring with silence to reduce cold-start underruns
7. Retries up to 15 times with exponential backoff (30ms base, capped growth) if connection is not ready

IO clients are reference-counted; `OnStopIO` disconnects shared memory when the last client stops.

### OnWriteMixedOutput

This callback runs on the audio IO thread for each buffer. It:

1. Updates `driver_heartbeat` and `driver_connected` via `rf_update_driver_heartbeat()`
2. Reads current stream `AudioStreamBasicDescription`
3. Rebuilds conversion/resampler state on format changes (sample rate/channel count)
4. Converts input to interleaved float32
5. Compensates timestamp gaps/overlaps by prepending silence or skipping frames
6. Applies linear-interpolation sample-rate conversion when needed
7. Applies adaptive drift compensation around target ring fill
8. Writes frames with `rf_ring_write()` and logs periodic stats every 30 seconds

Implemented input conversion paths in `ConvertToFloat32Interleaved()`:

- Float32 (interleaved and non-interleaved)
- Signed Int16
- Signed Int24 (packed 3-byte)
- Signed Int32

## Shared memory layout (`RFSharedAudio`)

Defined in `include/RFSharedAudio.h`.
In this build, `sizeof(RFSharedAudio)` is 264 bytes, and `audio_data[]` begins at offset 264.

### Header fields

| Offset | Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `protocol_version` | `uint32_t` | `0x00020000` |
| 4 | `header_size` | `uint32_t` | `sizeof(RFSharedAudio)` |
| 8 | `sample_rate` | `uint32_t` | 44100, 48000, 88200, 96000, 176400, 192000 |
| 12 | `channels` | `uint32_t` | 1-8 |
| 16 | `format` | `uint32_t` | `RFAudioFormat` enum |
| 20 | `bytes_per_sample` | `uint32_t` | Derived from format |

| 32 | `ring_duration_ms` | `uint32_t` | Default 100 (allowed 20-100) |
| 36 | `driver_capabilities` | `uint32_t` | `RF_CAP_*` bitmask |

| 124 | `host_connected` | `atomic uint32_t` | Host connection flag |
| 128 | `driver_heartbeat` | `atomic uint64_t` | Driver heartbeat |
| 136 | `host_heartbeat` | `atomic uint64_t` | Host heartbeat |
| 144-263 | `_reserved` | `uint8_t[120]` | Future expansion |
| 264+ | `audio_data[]` | `uint8_t[]` | `ring_capacity_frames * bytes_per_frame` bytes |

### Total mapped size

```
sizeof(RFSharedAudio) + (ring_capacity_frames * channels * bytes_per_sample)
```

Example at 48 kHz, 2 channels, float32, 100 ms (in this build):
`264 + (4800 * 2 * 4) = 38664` bytes.

### Ring buffer behavior

Single producer (driver) and single consumer (host), with monotonically increasing 64-bit indices.

- Overflow (`used + write > capacity`): advance `read_index` and increment `overrun_count`
- Underrun on host read: host emits silence and increments `underrun_count`

`rf_ring_write()` accepts float32 input and stores samples in negotiated shared format. `rf_ring_read()` outputs float32 for host-side processing.

## Health monitoring

Current liveness checks are applied during proxy-device sync (not in the per-buffer IO callback path):

- `HostHeartbeatFresh()` maps `/tmp/radioform-<uid>` read-only, tracks `host_heartbeat` changes, and treats heartbeat as stale after 5 seconds with no change.
- `SyncDevices()` only keeps/adds devices with fresh heartbeat state; stale entries are skipped and existing stale devices are removed.

`UniversalAudioHandler` also includes `IsHealthy()` and `AttemptRecovery()` helpers for shared-memory/file/ring validation, but they are not currently called from `OnWriteMixedOutput()`.

## Heartbeat protocol

- Driver calls `rf_update_driver_heartbeat()` on each `OnWriteMixedOutput` callback.
- Host calls `rf_update_host_heartbeat()` on a timer (`DispatchSourceTimer` in host code, default 1s interval).

A host heartbeat with no observed change for 5 seconds is treated as stale by `HostHeartbeatFresh()`.

## Building

Requirements:

- macOS (HAL driver target)
- CMake >= 3.20
- C++17 toolchain

```sh
cd packages/driver
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

Output bundle: `build/RadioformDriver.driver`

Debug build (AddressSanitizer enabled by project flags):

```sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
```

## Installing

```sh
cd packages/driver
./install.sh
sudo killall coreaudiod
```

Notes:

- `install.sh` expects `./build/RadioformDriver.driver` to exist.
- Script prompts for admin rights (`sudo`) internally for copy/ownership changes.
- Install target: `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/RadioformDriver.driver`
- Restarting `coreaudiod` is required for load/unload and interrupts audio briefly.

## Uninstalling

```sh
cd packages/driver
./uninstall.sh
sudo killall coreaudiod
```

## Logging

- `os_log` subsystem: `com.radioform.driver`
- Fallback file log: `/tmp/radioform-driver-debug.log`

Example unified log query:

```sh
log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.radioform.driver"' --last 5m
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| No proxy devices appear | Confirm host is running and `/tmp/radioform-devices.txt` exists |
| `OnStartIO` fails after retries | Confirm shared memory files exist: `ls /tmp/radioform-*` |
| Audio dropouts | Inspect overrun/underrun stats in logs |
| Driver not loading | Verify install path and restart `coreaudiod` |
| Stale proxy devices | Remove stale `/tmp/radioform-devices.txt` entry source and restart host/`coreaudiod` |
